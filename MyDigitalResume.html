# **Research Interests**

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and climate science, with a focus on developing computationally efficient solutions to pressing environmental challenges. I am currently working on creating neural network-based emulators for complex Earth System Models (ESMs), a technique designed to drastically accelerate climate projection simulations. By building these fast and accurate surrogate models, my goal is to make high-resolution climate analysis more accessible. This forms the foundation for proactive tools, such as climate displacement early warning systems, that can better predict and mitigate the human impact of extreme weather events.

To ground these predictive models, a key part of my research involves the robust calibration of remote sensing data. I am particularly focused on developing methodologies to fuse and calibrate European Space Agency (ESA) satellite data with in-situ ground sensor readings, especially in regions disparately affected by climate extremes.  Ensuring this data alignment is crucial for reducing uncertainty and enhancing the reliability of localized climate impact models, which is the necessary first step toward developing dependable real-world applications.

Crucially, my approach to developing these models is rooted in a commitment to ethical AI and social equity. I believe the communities most disproportionately affected by climate extremes mustn't be just subjects of the data but active participants in creating these solutions. This involves designing models that are transparent, fair, and directly address the needs and contexts of vulnerable populations. This ensures that the outputs do not perpetuate existing biases but instead empower inclusive and just climate adaptation strategies.

The ultimate application of this ethically-grounded research is to translate these predictive capabilities into actionable humanitarian intelligence. I am particularly motivated to further the mission of organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) by developing weather anomaly systems that can provide critical foresight for their field operations. By forecasting impending floods, droughts, or heatwaves with greater lead time and geographic precision, these tools can enable the prepositioning of medical supplies, the proactive deployment of mobile clinics, and the anticipation of public health crises, directly supporting life-saving interventions in the world's most vulnerable communities.
